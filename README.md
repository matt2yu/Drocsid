-   Drocsid is a clone of the popular chat and voice application, [Discord](http://discord.com/), mirroring some of the same functionality as the site from which it was inspired. Drocsid allows users to seamlessly sign up and start live-chatting within the server's channels. Intuitive navigation allows users to hop around from server to server and list out the channels and member lists. Messages are sent in real-time and are automatically saved for users who are live.
